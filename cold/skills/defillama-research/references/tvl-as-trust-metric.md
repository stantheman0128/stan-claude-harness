# TVL as a Trust Metric

How to read TVL data to assess protocol health and ecosystem trust.

## What TVL Tells You

TVL = Total Value Locked = real money deposited in smart contracts. It's the closest thing DeFi has to a trust signal because:

- **Users risked real capital** — not just signups or clicks
- **Higher TVL = more battle-tested** — more eyes on the code, more at stake
- **TVL trends reveal momentum** — growing TVL means growing trust

## TVL Tiers (Solana)

| Tier | TVL Range | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Tier 1 | $1B+ | Market leader. Building on this is safe but competitive. (e.g., Jupiter, Marinade, Jito) |
| Tier 2 | $100M - $1B | Established. Good integration targets — proven but still accessible. |
| Tier 3 | $10M - $100M | Growing. Potential partners, potential competitors. Watch the trend. |
| Tier 4 | $1M - $10M | Early stage. High risk, high opportunity. Could be the next breakout. |
| Tier 5 | < $1M | Experimental. Don't build on this unless you know the team. |

## Beyond Raw TVL

### TVL Change (7d / 30d)

| Trend | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Growing > 20% monthly | Strong momentum — users are pouring in |
| Stable (±5%) | Mature protocol, reliable but not exciting |
| Declining > 10% monthly | Losing trust — users are withdrawing |
| Spiking then crashing | Likely incentivized (farming) — not organic |

### TVL vs. Fees/Revenue

| Ratio | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| High TVL, high fees | Healthy protocol — real usage generating real revenue |
| High TVL, low fees | Capital parking — TVL is there for yield farming, not utility |
| Low TVL, high fees | Efficient protocol — generates value per dollar locked |
| Low TVL, low fees | Early or dying — check the trend |

### TVL per Category

Track which DeFi categories are growing on Solana. Use DefiLlama to get current leaders per category rather than relying on this list — protocols can decline or shut down between updates.

Common categories: Lending, DEXs, Liquid Staking, Derivatives, Yield. See `data/solana-knowledge/04-protocols-and-sdks.md` → Decision Quick Reference for current protocol recommendations, and "Protocol Health Verification" for how to validate them.

A category with growing aggregate TVL = growing demand = opportunity to build tools, aggregators, or new entrants.

## How to Use TVL for Idea Validation

1. **"Build on top of Tier 1-2"** — Integrate with proven protocols (Jupiter for swaps, Helius for data)
2. **"Compete in Tier 3-4"** — If a Tier 3 protocol is growing and has obvious UX gaps, that's your opening
3. **"Fill the gap"** — If a DeFi category has high TVL on Ethereum but low on Solana, there's unmet demand
4. **"Watch the flows"** — Stablecoin inflows to Solana = new capital looking for yield/products

## Red Flags

- TVL spike right after token incentives launch → not organic
- Single whale dominates TVL (check on-chain) → fragile
- TVL growing but fees declining → users aren't actually using the protocol
- Protocol TVL growing while chain TVL is flat → zero-sum game with neighbors
